# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

##  Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages
Deploy the React app to GitHub Pages

$ npm run deploy
That will cause the predeploy and deploy scripts defined in package.json to run.

Under the hood, the predeploy script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named build. Then, the deploy script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the gh-pages branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.

By default, the new commit on the gh-pages branch will have a commit message of "Updates". You can specify a custom commit message via the -m option, like this:

$ npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
GitHub Pages will automatically detect that a new commit has been added to the gh-pages branch of the GitHub repository. Once it detects that, it will begin serving the files that make up that commit — in this case, the distributable version of the React app — to anyone that visits the homepage URL you specified in Step 4.

That's it! The React app has been deployed to GitHub Pages! 🚀

At this point, the React app is accessible to anyone who visits the homepage URL you specified in Step 4. For example, the React app I deployed is accessible at https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages.

## (Optional) Store the React app's source code on GitHub
In the previous step, the gh-pages npm package pushed the distributable version of the React app to a branch named gh-pages in the GitHub repository. However, the source code of the React app is not yet stored on GitHub.

In this step, I'll show you how you can store the source code of the React app on GitHub.

Commit the changes you made while you were following this tutorial, to the master branch of the local Git repository; then, push that branch up to the master branch of the GitHub repository.

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Configure React app for deployment to GitHub Pages"
$ git push origin master
I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. It will have two branches: master and gh-pages. The master branch will contain the React app's source code, while the gh-pages branch will contain the distributable version of the React app.
